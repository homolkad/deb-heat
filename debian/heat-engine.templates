Default: true
_Description: Set up a database for heat-engine?
 No database has been set up for heat-engine to use. Before continuing, you
 should make sure you have:
 .
  - the server host name (that server must allow TCP connections from this
    machine);
  - a username and password to access the database.
  - A database type that you want to use.
 .
 If some of these requirements are missing, reject this option and run with  
 regular sqlite support.
 .
 You can change this setting later on by running 'dpkg-reconfigure -plow  
 heat-engine'.
